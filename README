# Quickstart:
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) type 'make' in the ggHH process folder
  2) go to the folder 'testrun'
  3) edit the input file powheg.input-save
  4) type './run.sh all'

The above will automatically prepare the grid files in the folder from which the
program is run (e.g. 'testrun'). The grids are then combined into one, for the 
specific values of the anomalous couplings as defined in the POWHEG runcard.
This step is necessary whether the user uses the run.sh script to perform the 
actual runs, or submits jobs on their own.

Note that the script ./run.sh will perform POWHEG's parallelstages 1-4
sequentially.  The time taken for all 4 steps may exceed wall clock limits on a
cluster.  In this case it is advisable to submit jobs for each parallelstage
separately.  Running only parallelstage 1 for example can be easily achieved by
putting a command 'exit' into run.sh before the line 'parstage=2'. Then
parallelstage 2 can be submitted; it will use the POWHEG files produced in
parallelstage 1.  Similarly for stages 3 (upper bounding functions) and 4
(generation of the LHE files).

To just generate the grids (but do not run parallelstages 1-4) it is sufficient
to call

  ./run.sh warmup

once in the run folder (e.g. 'testrun'). 

The available options are also displayed with

  ./run.sh help

This model is heavily based on svn rev 4040 of `User-Processes-V2/ggHH` and differs
from the latter in that the quartic Higgs self-coupling is introduced as a parameter.
For more information about the original `ggHH` model, please consult Ref. [3] and
its software documentation in `User-Processes-V2/ggHH/Docs`.
