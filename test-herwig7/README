To run Herwig7 on LHE files, make sure you compiled the powhegHerwig.so library
in the ggHH/Herwig7.1 directory by running "make". You may need to export your
Herwig bin/ installation path to PATH, or do

        source /PATHTOHERWIG/bin/activate

Link the Herwig interface library in your run directory with

        ln -s ../Herwig7.1/powhegHerwig.so


Then you can run directly on a single LHE file with


	(echo pwgevents-0001.lhe) | sh HerwigRun.sh


The program runs the analysis and produces a pwg-POWHEG+HERWIG7 top file with 
the histograms.

The parameters entering the Herwig runcard are defined in the HerwigRun.sh
script and can be changed accordingly. To change the shower, check the flag

        showeralg='default' / showeralg='dipole'
